## Troubleshooting üîß

### Common Issues & Solutions

**‚ùå Build Failed**
- Check `package.json` is in repository root
- Verify all dependencies are listed
- Check Node.js version compatibility

**‚ùå Bot Not Online**
- Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct
- Check `CLIENT_ID` matches your bot
- Ensure bot has proper permissions

**‚ùå Commands Not Working**
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Discord cache
- Run `node deploy-commands.js` locally to verify
- Check bot has "Use Application Commands" permission

**‚ùå Health Check Failing**
- Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- Check Express is installed: `npm install express`
- Verify health server starts in logs

**‚ùå Service Sleeping (Free Tier)**
- Confirm UptimeRobot is pinging every 5 minutes
- Consider upgrading to Starter plan ($7/month)
- Check total monthly usage (750 hours limit)

## Success Indicators üéâ

You'll know everything is working when:

1. **Render Dashboard**: Shows service as "Live" 
2. **Discord**: Bot appears online and responds to commands
3. **UptimeRobot**: Shows 99%+ uptime
4. **Health Endpoints**: Return 200 OK responses
5. **Logs**: Show no errors, regular activity

## Maintenance üîß

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor UptimeRobot for downtime alerts
- Check Render logs weekly for errors
- Update dependencies monthly: `npm update`
- Monitor usage to stay within free tier limits

### Upgrading
Consider upgrading to paid plans when:
- Free tier hours run out (750/month)
- Need guaranteed uptime (always-on)
- Require better performance
- Want priority support
